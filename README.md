# copy_when_uncertain

This repository contains code and results for an assignment in my Cognitive Robotics Class at Queen Mary University London

It is based on prior work by Smolla et al[[1](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0188)] in which it was shown that bumblebees rely more on social learning strategies
in situations of uncertainty.

My extension to this study was to investigate the timing of learning in situations of uncertainty. That is, to investigate whether high variance in the rewards
received by the simulated bees influenced the bees to prioritize learning earlier in their lifecycles, and then exploit their knowledge later in their lifecycles.


The results from the simulation in this study are stored in two separate CSV files within this repository
